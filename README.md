# Online Course -- JavaScript

As a continued past of my learning strategy, to facilitate the improvement 
of my coding skills and tutoring sessions, I have begun taking several courses 
from various instructors to gain perspective on how others explain and teach programming
languages. With each course I include a repo of the work and lessons I complete as a reference
point. Not only for myself but for others to view and learn from.

This course is a full walk through of Javascript. I add in comments and notes for improved
explanation.
